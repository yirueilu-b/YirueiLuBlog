## What is Machine Learning

從人類學習事物的角度看何謂機器學習、為何要用機器學習，並舉出實際應用範例與細部流程，最後將機器學習的流程化作符號表示來定義機器學習。

### From Learning to Machine Learning

從學習的角度粗略定義機器學習

- learning: 
    acquiring skill with experience accumulated from **observations**
    
    `observations -> learning -> skill`
    
- machine leraning
    acquiring skill with experience accumulated/computed from **data**

    `data -> ML -> skill`

    > $\text{skill} \Leftrightarrow \text{imporve some performance measure}$
 
    `stock_data -> ML -> more_investment_gain`

### Why Use Machine Learning

為何使用機器學習來解決問題

- Tree Recognition
    Consider a tree recognition task, how to define a tree to make computer be able to recognize a tree

    - Rule-based: define trees and hand-program
    - ML-based: learn from data

    ML-based tree recognition system can be easier to build then hand-programmed system

    **ML is an alterntive route to build complicated systems**

- Some Use Scenarios
    - when human cannot program the system manually
        - navigating on Mars
            cannot list all conditions on Mars
    - when human cannot define the solution easily
        - speech/visual recognition
            like tree recognition (rules not work)
    - when needing rapid decisions that humans cannot do
        - high-frequency trading
            Human cannot react that fast
    - when needing to be user-oriented in a massive scale
        - consumer-targeted marketing

### 3 Key Essences of Machine Learning

需要使用機器學習來解決問題的三個關鍵因素

If a problem holds these three keys then we could attempt to use ML to solve it

- exists **some underlying pattern to be learned**
    so "performance measure" can be imporved
    
- but no programmable ( easy ) definition
    so "ML" is needed

- somehow there is data about the pattern
    so ML has some "inputs" to learn from
    
    
## Applications of Machine Learning

使用機器學習解決的問題案例

### Food 

- data: 
    Twitter data ( word and location )
- skill: 
    tell food poisoning likeliness of restaurant properly ( clean )

### Cloth

- data:
    sales figures and client surveys
- skill: 
    give good fashion recommendation to clients

### House

- data: 
    characteristics of buildings and their energyload
- skill:
    predict energy load of other building closely

### Transportation

- data: 
    some traffic sign iamges and meanings
- skill: 
    recognize traffic signs accurately

### Education

- data: 
    students' records on quizzes on Math tutoring system
- skill: 
    predict whether a student can give a correct answer to another quiz question
- a possible ML solution:
    answer correctly = recent strength of student > difficulty of question
    - give ML 9 million records from 300 students
    - ML determines ( reverse-engineers ) strength and difficulty automatically

### Entertainment

- data: how many users have rated some movies
- skill: predict how a user would rate an unrated movie
- a possible ML solution
    - pattern:
        rating <- viewer/movie factors
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/8HL2CR1.png)

    - learning:
        known rating -> learned factors, unknown rating prediction
        
## Components of Machine Learning

從抽象的描述到具體的機器學習，以信用卡核卡來看更細部的機器學習流程

We've seen several sample applications of ML, let's see the details indide the ML

### Components of Learning: Metaphor Using Credit Approval

- Application Information
    |feature|value|
    |-|-|
    |age|23 years|
    |gender|female|
    |annual salary|NTD 1,000,000|
    |year in residense|1 year|
    |year in job|0.5 year|
    |current debt|200,000|
    unknown pattern to be learned:
        approve credit card good for bank?
    
### Formalize the Learning Problem

使用符號定義上述問題

- Basic Notations
    - **input**: 
        $x \in X$ ( customer application )
    - **output**:
        $y \in Y$ ( good/bad after approving credit card )
    - **unknown pattern to be learned $\Leftrightarrow$ target function**:
        $f: X \rightarrow Y$ ( ideal credit card approval fofrmula )
    - **data $\Leftrightarrow$ training examples**:
        $D=\{(x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2),...,(x_n, y_n\}$ (historical records in bank)
    - **hypothesis $\Leftrightarrow$ skill with hopefully good performance**:
        $g: X \rightarrow Y$ ( learned formula to be used )
        
**$\{(x_n, y_n)\} \text{ from f} \rightarrow ML \rightarrow g$**

從資料( $\{(x_n, y_n)\}$ )出發經過學習( $ML$ )得到 $g$

### Learning Flow for Credit Approval

更詳細的流程圖
![](https://i.imgur.com/TEGFwUd.png)

- target $f$ unknown (i.e. no programmable definition)
- hypothesis $g$ hopefully $\approx f$ but possibly different from $f$ ( perfection impossible when $f$ unknown )

### The Learning Model

$g \rightarrow$ 從很多的公式或稱假設中( $H$ )選出最好的( $h_k$ )當作 $g$

![](https://i.imgur.com/mX1ZKF4.png)

assume $g \in H = \{h_k\}$, i.e. approving if
- $h_1:$ annual salary > NTD 800,000
- $h_2:$ debt > NTD 100,000
- $h_3:$ year in job <= 2

hypothesis set $H$
- can contain good or bad hypotheses
- up to $A$ to pick the best one as $g$

**Learning model = $A$ and $H$**

### Practical Definition of Machine Learning

![](https://i.imgur.com/tj1sx5i.png)

Machine Learning:
Use data to compute hypothesis $g$ that approximates target $f$

從資料出發算出一個 $g$ 接近 $f$

## Machine Learning and Other Fields

其他相似領域與機器學習的相同與差異

### Machine Learning and Data Mining

Machine Learning:
use data to compute hypothesis $g$ that approximates $f$

Data Mining:
use ( huge ) data to find property that is interesting
    
- if interesting property same as hypothesis that approximate target
    ML = DM ( usually what KDDCup does )
- if interesting property related to hypothesis that approximate target
    DM can help ML, and vice versa ( often, but not always 
- traditional DM also focuses on effcient computation in large database

**difficult to distinguish ML and DM in reality**

資料探勘與機器學習相輔相成很難完全區分

### Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine Learning:
use data to compute hypothesis $g$ that approximates $f$

Artificial Intelligence:
compute something that shows intelligent behavior

- $g \approx f$ is something that shows intelligent behavior
    ML can realize AI, among other routes
    e.g. chess playing
    - traditional AI: game tree
    - ML for AI: learning from games

機器學習是實現人工智慧的一種方式

### Machine Learning and Statistics

Machine Learning:
use data to compute hypothesis $g$ that approximates $f$

Statistics:
use data to make inference about an unknown process

- $g$ is an inference outcome; $f$ is something unknown
    statistics can be used to achieve ML
- traditional statistics also focus on provable results with math assumptions, and care less about computation

statistics: many useful tools for ML

統計強調數學上的假設與推論證明，機器學習強調如何計算出來，從電腦科學角度出發，統計有很多機器學習的實用工具

## Conclusion

- use data to approximate target
- ML is everywhere
- $A$ takes $D$ and $H$ to get $g$ approximates $f$
- ML have many related fields
